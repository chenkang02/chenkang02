- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Chen Kang. I am living in Malaysia and is soon going to be a first year undergraduate student in computer science, software engineering to be specific. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming and computer science. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and C. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me. You can contact me through github or instagram at @chenkangg

I am still relatively new to all of these, given how my original plan was to be a doctor. I have never taken any computer science class in my high school but yeah I am trying my best to pick up the pace.
