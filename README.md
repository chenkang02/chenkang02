Hey, my name is Chen Kang and I am currently a final year computer science student, majoring in Software Engineering in University Malaya. 
My primary interest is in developing web and mobile applications that solves current day's problem. 
My primary interest and expectation in the course WIF3005 is to learn how to make the systems that I will be developing in the future more maintainable and scalable.
